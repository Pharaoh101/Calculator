# Calculator
This is a test, just a small project for me to create a calculator.
I am following the following tutorial for the time being (https://medium.com/@jovanoilixua/react-native-experiment-building-a-calculator-ee7cb1d4ae21), but eventually will be playing around with it myself in an effort to understand React Native better.

I'll be writing learning points here and other key things that pop up as I write this.

Fonts:

So using Fonts in React seems to be a bit of a pain, though the following link shows a way around it. It is a workaround however, so for now I'll stick to using default fonts until I see the need to use a unique font or iconography.
